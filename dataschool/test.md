# Heading Size One

A couple of years ago, I put on my shoes, grabbed my purse, and asked my dog, Luna, if she needed anything from the bodega. It was then that I realized just how deep into the madness of pet anthropomorphism I had sunk. My excuse, of course, is the same as every other nut job’s. I swear that Luna, a fluffy, mischievous, ninety-pound Border collie–Great Pyrenees mix, is basically a human. She’s as big as one, anyway, and as expressive. Friends come over for parties, gaze into her skeptical hazel eyes, and inform me that Luna resembles a person wearing a dog suit. Because I work from home, I’ve spent much more time with her than I have with my actual human partner, and every day I observe her mood shifting like the light in our apartment: she’s sleepy; she’s hyper; she’s on edge; she’s happy; she wants to be left alone. Like most dog-owners, I have developed an embarrassing voice that I use to ventriloquize her thoughts and feelings (as I imagine them, anyway), and, if Luna were docile enough to dress up in anything more complicated than a bandanna, I would probably style a full outfit for her every day.

## Lists

People love lists because they provide very clear breaks in the visual hierarchy and are easy to scan. Lists formatted with GRT are beautifully spaced and will keep your visitors engaged and moving down the page.

*   Unordered list item 1
*   Unordered list item 2
*   Unordered list item 3
    *   Nested list item 1
    *   Nested list item 2
*   Unordered list item 4

But what about ordered lists? We’ve got those covered, too:<sup id="f2r">[2](#f2)</sup>

1.  Ordered list item 1
2.  Ordered list item 2
3.  Ordered list item 3
4.  Ordered list item 4

## Blockquotes

When including a quote or citation in your content, be sure to use `<blockquote>` styles for the most savvy presentation. Consider this profound statement about typography:

> The mathematical proportions of typography are vitally important to how readers perceive both your site and your content.

Heavy!


## Code Formatting

You’ve already seen <code>inline code styling</code> via the `<code>` tag a few times on this page. GRT also provides tidy preformatted code styling via the `<pre>` tag, as seen in this snippet of fictitious <abbr title="recursive acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> code:

<pre> functionBaby(); </pre>


### Keyboard Formatting

Occasionally, you may need to give your readers directions that include keyboard references. The `<kbd>` element is perfect for this application:

#### Save

*   Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
*   Win: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>


#### Find

*   Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>
*   Win: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>


#### Replace

*   Mac: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>
*   Win: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>

## What is data integrity?

Data integrity refers to the fact that data must be reliable and accurate over its entire lifecycle. Data is expected to have the following features:

1. **Attributable:** Data should clearly demonstrate who observed and recorded it, when it was observed and recorded, and what it is about. This can be achieved by maintaining metadata which clearly describes the title, author and abstract.
2. **Legible:** Data should be easy to understand, recorded permanently and original entries should be preserved. It should include information regarding the content, format and structure of the database along with relationship between its elements.
3. **Contemporaneous:** Data should be recorded as it was observed, and at the time it was executed. Also, data should be ready to access and use as soon as it enters the system.
4. **Preserved:** Source data should be accessible and preserved in its original form. It must be stored in a secure location, stored across multiple locations and saved in formats that will have the highest utility in the future.
5. **Accurate:** Data should be free from errors, and conform with the protocol. It must be stored in a consistent and unambiguous form.
